              "\" Item 1A. Risk Factors \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nIn addition to the other information included in this Annual Report, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business, financial position and future prospects. Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or future prospects. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from what we have projected. Investing in our common stock is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Any potential investor should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before purchasing any shares of our common stock. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also materially adversely affect our business, financial position or future prospects. As a result, the trading price of our stock could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. Our business, financial condition, and operating results, or the value of any investment you make in the stock of our company, or both, could be adversely affected by any of the factors listed and described below. \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nWe have a history of generating significant losses and may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nTo date, we have not been profitable, and we may never achieve profitability on a full-year or consistent basis. We incurred net losses of $7,783,271 for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we have an accumulated deficit of $49,926,372. If we continue to experience losses, we may not be able to continue our operations, and investors may lose their entire investment.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur future development will require additional capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, which would prevent us from fully developing our business and generating revenues. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nAs of March 30, 2020, our cash available is approximately $1.6M. Our business plan will require additional capital expenditures, and our capital outlays could increase substantially over the next several years as we implement our business plan. As a result, we may need to raise additional capital through future private or public equity offerings, strategic alliances or debt financing. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others: market conditions, sales and marketing costs, mergers and acquisition activity, if any, costs of litigation in enforcing our patents, and information technology development and acquisition costs. No assurance can be given that we can successfully raise additional equity or debt capital, or that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.\\n\\n&#160; &#160; \\n\\nWe have been subject to litigation and may in the future be subject to additional litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. &#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe may become involved in various routine disputes and allegations incidental to our business operations. Because it is not possible to determine when and whether these disputes and allegations may arise or the ultimate disposition of such matters, the resolution of any such matters, should they arise, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWeakened global economic conditions including current and ongoing microeconomic uncertainty may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. In addition, geopolitical developments, such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control, such as the Coronavirus epidemic, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. For example, in response to the Coronavirus epidemic, we have shifted certain of our customer events to virtual-only experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. Moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of IT spending and could adversely affect our customers&#8217; ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our software, delay prospective customers&#8217; purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 14 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur revenue and collections may be materially adversely affected by an economic downturn. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nRecent macroeconomic conditions have shown signs of volatility and potential weakness. We believe commercial purchasing habits and corporate information technology budgets have improved in recent years but remain relatively constrained and subject to such volatile and potentially weak economic conditions. Any deterioration in prevailing economic conditions would likely result in reduced demand for our services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nAn increase in market interest rates could increase our interest costs on future debt and could adversely affect our stock price. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nIf interest rates increase, so could our interest costs for any new debt. This increased cost could make financing, including the financing of any acquisition, costlier. We may incur variable interest rate indebtedness in the future. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increased interest expense on refinanced indebtedness.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur success is dependent on certain members of our management and technical team. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our senior management team and key employees, including our engineers, product managers, sales and marketing personnel, and professional services personnel. Our future success will also depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire and retain additional skilled and highly qualified personnel, including a new chief financial officer, which will require significant time, expense and attention. We cannot assure you that our management will remain in place or as to the time it will take for us to identify, hire and retain a new chief financial officer. We do not maintain &#8220;key person&#8221; life insurance policies. The loss of any of our management and technical team members could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nWe intend to pursue new strategic opportunities which may result in the use of a significant amount of our management resources or significant costs, and we may not be able to fully realize the potential benefit of such opportunities. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe intend to seek other strategic partners to help us pursue our strategic, marketing, sales, or technical objectives. Although we may devote significant time and resources in pursuit of such transactions, we may struggle to successfully identify such opportunities, or to successfully conclude transactions with potential strategic partners. Should we be unable to identify or conclude important strategic transactions, our business prospects and operations could be adversely affected as a result of the devotion of significant managerial effort required, and the challenges of achieving our objectives in the absence of strategic partners. In addition, we may incur significant costs in connection with seeking acquisitions or other strategic opportunities regardless of whether the transaction is completed, and in combining its operations if such a transaction is completed. In the event that we consummate an acquisition or strategic alternative in the future, we cannot assure you that we would fully realize the potential benefit of such a transaction.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nOur business plan may not be realized. If our business plan proves to be unsuccessful, our business may fail, and you may lose your entire investment. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise with a limited operating history. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development of a new business. Unanticipated events may occur that could affect the actual results achieved during the forecast periods. Consequently, the actual results of operations during the forecast periods will vary from the forecasts, and such variations may be material. In addition, the degree of uncertainty increases with each successive year presented in our business plan. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in the anticipated operation of our business plan. If our business plan proves to be unsuccessful, our business may fail, and you may lose your entire investment.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 15 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience competition as more companies seek to provide products and services similar to our products and services and because larger and better-financed competitors may affect our ability to compete in the marketplace and achieve profitability, our business may fail. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nCompetition in our market is intense, and we expect competition for our products and services to become even more intense. We compete directly against other companies offering similar products and services that compete or will compete directly with our proposed products and services. We also compete against established vendors in our markets. These companies may incorporate other competitive technologies into their product offerings, whether developed internally or by third parties. There are also established consultants who offer services to help their customers obtain compliance with accessibilities standards. In many cases these consultants compete for the same funding from our prospective customers. For the foreseeable future, substantially all our competitors are likely to be larger, better-financed companies that may develop products superior to our current and proposed products, which could create significant competitive advantages for those companies. Our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively with our competitors. As a result, we may have difficulty competing with larger, established competitors. Generally, these competitors have:\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; a larger customer base; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; better name recognition; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; more expansive or different product offerings. ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\nThese competitors may command a larger market share than we do, which may enable them to establish a stronger competitive position, in part, through greater marketing opportunities. Further, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we are to new or emerging technologies and changes in user preferences and to devote greater resources to developing new products and offering new services. These competitors may develop products or services that are comparable or superior to ours. If we fail to address competitive developments quickly and effectively, we may not be able to remain a viable business.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nIf we are not able to adequately protect our patented rights, our operations would be negatively impacted. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur ability to compete largely depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of our technology and intellectual property. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. We cannot assure you that infringement or invalidity claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted or prosecuted against us or that any such assertions or prosecutions will not materially adversely affect our business.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nRegardless of whether any future claims are valid or can be successfully asserted, defending against such claims could cause us to incur significant costs, could jeopardize or substantially delay a successful outcome in any future litigation, and could divert resources away from our other activities. In addition, assertion of infringement claims could result in injunctions that prevent us from distributing our products. In addition to challenges against our existing patents, any of the following could also reduce the value of our intellectual property now, or in the future: \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; our applications for patents, trademarks, and copyrights relating to our business may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; issued trademarks, copyrights or patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 16 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology; or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; our efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, competitive with, or superior to those that we develop. ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\nAlso, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries where we may do business in the future or from which competitors may operate. Obtaining patents will not necessarily protect our technology or prevent our international competitors from developing similar products or technologies. Our inability to adequately protect our patented rights would have a negative impact on our operations and revenues.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nIn addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related businesses are uncertain and still evolving. Because of the growth of the Internet and Internet-related businesses, patent applications are continuously and simultaneously being filed in connection with Internet-related technology. There are a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest, and we believe that there has been, and is likely to continue to be, significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nWe may commence legal proceedings against third parties who we believe are infringing on our intellectual property rights, and if we are forced to litigate to defend our intellectual property rights, or to defend claims by third parties against us relating to intellectual property rights, legal fees and court injunctions could adversely affect our financial condition and potentially end our business. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nAt present, we do not have any active or pending litigation related to the violation of our patents. We expect an increase in the number of third parties who could violate our patents as the market develops new uses of similar products and consumers begin to increase their adoption of the technology and integrate it into their daily lives. We foresee the potential need to enter into active litigation to defend and enforce our patents. We anticipate that these legal proceedings could continue for several years and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses. In the event we are not successful through appeal and do not subsequently obtain monetary and injunctive relief, these litigation matters may significantly reduce our financial resources and have a material impact on our ability to continue our operations. The time and effort required of our management to effectively pursue or defend these litigation matters may adversely affect our ability to operate our business, since time spent on matters related to the lawsuits would take away from the time spent on managing and operating the business. We cannot assure you any such potential lawsuits will result in an outcome that is favorable to our stockholders or the Company.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nThe burdens of being a public company may adversely affect our ability to develop our business and pursue a litigation strategy. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nSince we are a public company, our management must devote substantial time, attention, and financial resources to comply with U.S. securities laws. This may have a material adverse effect on our management&#8217;s ability to effectively and efficiently develop our business initiatives. In addition, our disclosure obligations under U.S. securities laws may require us to disclose information publicly that could have a material adverse effect on our potential litigation strategies.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nThe current regulatory environment for our products and services remains unclear. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe cannot assure you that our existing or planned product and service offerings will be in compliance with local, state, and/or federal U.S. laws or the laws of any foreign jurisdiction where we operate or may operate in the future. Further, we cannot assure you that we will not unintentionally violate such laws or that such laws will not be modified, or that new laws will not be enacted in the future, which would cause us to be in violation of such laws. More aggressive domestic or international regulation of the Internet may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future prospects.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 17 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nAs pressure of legal ramifications from non-compliance with Web Accessibility increases, customers may be less inclined to permit or may delay AudioEye from promoting client relationships and/or the specifics associated with those relationships, and if this restricts our public communications with potential investors and stockholders, it may negatively impact our ability to gain interest in our business from potential investors and stockholders. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nDue to an undefined regulatory environment and a heightened sensitivity by plaintiffs seeking retribution for inaccessible and unusable digital interfaces, any organization may be sued or faced with legal demands claiming non-compliance. As these legal actions or demands may be initiated with or without merit, they present a new level of risk for website owners and publishers. In an effort to avoid any potential unwanted attention pertaining to the subject of compliance, AudioEye clients may enforce rigid stipulations pertaining to AudioEye&#8217;s promotion of their involvement or engagement with AudioEye, regardless of the level of success or positive impact any such engagement may have or have had on their businesses. Whether through the enforcement of non-disclosure agreements or through specific non-disclosure language associated with client contracts, if AudioEye is not empowered to promptly make public announcements about its client base and the adoption and success of AudioEye products and services, there may be a deleterious effect on the Company&#8217;s capacity to accelerate its business growth or attract investment from existing or future investors and stockholders.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur business greatly depends on the growth of online services, Internet of Things (&#8220;IOT&#8221;), kiosks, streaming, and other next-generation Internet-based applications, and there is a risk that such growth may not occur as expected, or at all, which would harm our business. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nThe Internet may ultimately prove not to be a viable commercial marketplace for such applications for several reasons, including:\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; unwillingness of consumers to shift to and use other such next-generation Internet-based audio applications; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; refusal to purchase our products and services; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; perception by end-users with respect to product and service quality and performance; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; limitations on access and ease of use; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; congestion leading to delayed or extended response times; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; inadequate development of Internet infrastructure to keep pace with increased levels of use; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; increased government regulations. ##TABLE_END &#160; \\n\\nBecause of these and other factors, the growth of online services, IOT, kiosks, streaming, and other next-generation Internet-based applications may be impeded or not occur as expected. As a result, our business and operations could be adversely impacted.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nIf the market for our online services does not grow as anticipated, our business would be adversely affected. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWhile other next-generation Internet-based applications have grown rapidly in personal and professional use, we cannot assure you that the adoption of our products and services will grow at a comparable rate or grow at all.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nWe expect that we will experience long and unpredictable sales cycles, which may impact our operating results. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe expect that our sales cycles will be long and unpredictable due to a number of uncertainties such as:\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; the need to educate potential customers about the current state of accessibility for those with disabilities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; customers&#8217; willingness to invest potentially substantial resources and infrastructures to take advantage of our products and services; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 18 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; customers&#8217; budgetary constraints; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; the timing of customers&#8217; budget cycles; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; delays caused by customers&#8217; internal review and procurement processes. ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\nThese factors may create additional lead time before a sale is finalized and may lead to longer than expected and unpredictable sales cycles, which could delay or reduce our revenue and impact our operating results.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional business, legal, financial, and competitive risks. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our new offerings. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. If we are unable to continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nGovernment regulation is evolving, and unfavorable changes could harm our business. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, web services, the provision of online payment services, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites, the characteristics and quality of products and services, and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, and web services. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nWe could be subject to additional sales tax or other indirect tax liabilities. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales. However, an increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices that attempt to impose obligations on out-of-state businesses to collect taxes on their behalf. A successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to collect taxes where we do not currently do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 19 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nIf we do not successfully develop our planned products and services in a cost-effective manner to meet customer demand in the rapidly evolving market for next-generation Internet-based applications and services, our business may fail. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nThe market for next-generation Internet-based applications and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, and frequent new service and product introductions. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to use new technologies effectively, to continue to develop our technical expertise and proprietary technology, to enhance our existing products and services, and to develop new products and services that meet changing customer needs on a timely and cost-effective basis. We may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing technology, customer requirements, and industry standards. If we fail to use new technologies effectively, to develop our technical expertise and new products and services, or to enhance existing products and services on a timely basis, either internally or through arrangements with third parties, our product and service offerings may fail to meet customer needs, which would adversely affect our revenues and prospects for growth.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nIn addition, if we are unable to, for technological, legal, financial, or other reasons, adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions or customer requirements, we could lose customers, strategic alliances, and market share. Sudden changes in user and customer requirements and preferences, the frequent introduction of new products and services embodying new technologies, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing products, services and systems obsolete. The emerging nature of products and services in the technology and communications industry and their rapid evolution will require that we continually improve the performance, features, and reliability of our products and services. Our survival and success will depend, in part, on our ability to:\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; design, develop, launch and/or license our planned products, services, and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers; and ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\nThe development of our planned products and services and other patented technology involves significant technological and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time. We may be unable to use new technologies effectively. Updating our technology internally and licensing new technology from third parties may also require us to incur significant additional expenditures.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nIf our products and services do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to fund future operations. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nA number of factors may affect the market acceptance of our products or services or any other products or services we develop or acquire, including, among others:\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; the price of our products or services relative to other competitive products and services; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; the perception by users of the effectiveness of our products and services; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; our ability to fund our sales and marketing efforts; and ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 20 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nIf our products and services do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to fund future operations, including the development of new products and services and/or our sales and marketing efforts for our current products and services, which inability would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe continually develop new products and product enhancements and actively capitalize software development costs, while making educated assumptions to anticipate the attributed revenue to be derived from each development or enhancement. If our assumptions are incorrect or if we are unable to accurately attribute revenue to each respective product or product enhancement, we may have to account for impairment, thus causing us to reverse the capitalized expenditures. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur product developers are consistently programming new products and enhancements to existing products. Under the guidance of U.S Accounting Standard, ASC 350-40, we make determinations to estimate the useful life of each of these products and enhancements. Based on these determinations, we amortize software expenses over a pre-determined period of time. Based on our financial forecasts and regular impairment testing, we believe that cash flows will be realized from our product development and product enhancements and will be sufficient to recover the value of the Company&#8217;s expenditures. Should our estimates turn out to be inaccurate or should the business fail to attract new revenue in relation to each respective product or product enhancement, we may have to reverse or write off the related capitalized expenses.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nOur products and services are highly technical and may contain undetected errors, which could cause harm to our reputation and adversely affect our business. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur products and services are highly technical and complex and, when deployed, may contain errors or defects. Despite testing, some errors in our products and services may only be discovered after they have been installed and used by customers. Any errors or defects discovered in our products and services after commercial release could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers, and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort, or breach of warranty. The performance of our products and services could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on third-party applications and services that utilize our products and services, which could result in legal claims against us, harming our business. Furthermore, we expect to provide implementation, consulting, and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our products and services, which typically involves working with sophisticated software, computing systems, and communications systems. We expect that our contracts with customers will contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert our management&#8217;s attention and adversely affect the market&#8217;s perception of us and our products and services. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nMalfunctions of third-party communications infrastructure, hardware and software expose us to a variety of risks we cannot control, and those risks could result in harm to our business. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur business depends upon the capacity, reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties over which our product offerings are deployed. We have no control over the operation, quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or over whether those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment. We do depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our integrated connections. If one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service in the future, our operations could be adversely impacted. System interruptions or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the appeal of the networks to users. In addition, users depend on real-time communications; outages caused by increased traffic could result in delays and system failures. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our products and services do not function properly and could therefore adversely affect our ability to attract and retain strategic partners and customers.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 21 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nSecurity breaches, computer viruses, and computer hacking attacks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, or reputation. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, or the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur corporate systems, third-party systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, a combination of these, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or any third-party data we may possess. Any such security breach could require us to comply with various breach notification laws and may expose us to litigation, remediation and investigation costs, increased costs for security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation, and potential liability.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nSystem failure or interruption or our failure to meet increasing demands on our systems could harm our business. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nThe success of our product and service offerings depends on the uninterrupted operation of various systems, secure data centers, and other computer and communication networks that we use or establish. To the extent the number of users of networks utilizing our future products and services suddenly increases, the technology platform and hosting services which will be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times, service interruptions or delays or system failures. The deployment of our products, services, systems and operations will also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; power loss, transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; damage or interruption caused by fire, earthquake and other natural disasters; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; computer viruses or software defects; and ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control. ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\nSystem interruptions or failures and increases or delays in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the appeal of our products and services to users. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our products and services do not function properly and could therefore adversely affect our ability to attract and retain strategic partners and customers.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nOur ability to sell our solutions will be dependent on the quality of our technical support and our failure to deliver high-quality technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nIf we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products and services, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues and provide effective ongoing support, or if potential customers perceive that we may not be able to successfully deliver the foregoing, our ability to sell our products and services would be adversely affected, and our reputation with customers and potential customers could be harmed. As a result, our failure to deliver and maintain high-quality technical support services to our customers could result in customers choosing to use our competitors&#8217; products or services in the future.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nGrowth of internal operations and business may strain our financial resources. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe may need to significantly expand the scope of our operating and financial systems in order to build our business. Our growth rate may place a significant strain on our financial resources for several reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 22 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; the need for continued development of our financial and information management systems; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; the need to manage relationships with future resellers, distributors and strategic partners; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; the need to hire and retain skilled management, technical and other personnel necessary to support and manage our business; and ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; the need to train and manage our employee base. ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\nThe addition of products and services and the attention they demand may also strain our management resources.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nWe do not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future, which will affect the extent to which our investors realize any future gains on their investment. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our convertible preferred and common stock in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, investors must rely on the ability to convert preferred stock to common stock and on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe will need to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel to successfully grow our business. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified operations, marketing and sales personnel as well as technical personnel. Inability to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business. Competition for technical, sales, marketing and executive personnel is intense, particularly in the technology and Internet sectors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain such personnel.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to report financial results accurately or on a timely basis, or to detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. &#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nIn connection with this annual report, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, primarily due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described in this annual report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2019 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur management had identified, and disclosed in last year&#8217;s annual report, control deficiencies in our financial reporting process that, as of December 31, 2018, constituted material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses related to the segregation of duties and the lack of formal policies that provide for multiple levels of supervision and reviews.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur failure to establish and maintain the required internal control over financial reporting, and to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, or any failure of those controls or procedures once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. Upon review of the required internal control over financial reporting, our management and/or our auditors have in the past and may in the future identify material weaknesses and/or significant deficiencies that need to be addressed. Any actual or perceived weaknesses or conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure of management's assessment of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of our independent registered public accounting firm's attestation to or report on management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, or our failure to obtain such an attestation or report, could adversely impact the price of and our ability to list our common stock and may lead to stockholder claims and regulatory action against us. Failure to remediate our current material weaknesses or to maintain effective internal controls in the future could also result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and that could cause us to restate our financial statements for a prior period, cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and/or limit our ability to raise capital.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 23 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nAdditionally, any such failure may also negatively impact our operating results and financial condition, impair our ability to timely file our periodic and other reports with the SEC, consume a significant amount of management's time, and cause us to incur substantial additional costs relating to the implementation of remedial measures.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nRisks Related to the Market for Our Common Stock \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nAlthough our shares of common stock are now listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we currently have a limited trading volume, which results in higher price volatility for, and reduced liquidity of, our common stock. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nAlthough our shares of common stock are now listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol &#8220;AEYE,&#8221; trading volume in our common stock has been limited and an active trading market for our shares of common stock may never develop or be maintained. The absence of an active trading market increases price volatility and reduces the liquidity of our common stock. As long as this condition continues, the sale of a significant number of shares of common stock at any particular time could be difficult to achieve at the market prices prevailing immediately before such shares are offered.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nIf we cannot continue to satisfy the continuing listing criteria of the NASDAQ Capital Market, the exchange may subsequently delist our common stock. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nThe NASDAQ Capital Market requires us to meet certain financial, public float, bid price and liquidity standards on an ongoing basis in order to continue the listing of our common stock. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount of stockholders&#8217; equity and a minimum number of holders of our securities, as well as meet certain disclosure and corporate governance requirements. If we fail to meet any of the continuing listing requirements, our common stock may be subject to delisting. If our common stock is delisted and we are not able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities. In addition, we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nThe market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses by our investors. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as:\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#183; the outcomes of potential future patent litigation; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#183; our ability to monetize our future patents; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#183; changes in our industry; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#183; announcements of technological innovations, new products or product enhancements by us or others; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#183; announcements by us of significant strategic partnerships, out-licensing, in-licensing, joint ventures, acquisitions or capital commitments; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#183; changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by security analysts, if our common stock is covered by analysts; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#183; investors&#8217; general perception of us; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#183; future issuances of common stock; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 24 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#183; investors&#8217; future resales of our securities under our currently effective Registration Statement on Form S-1; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#183; the addition or departure of key personnel; ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#183; general market conditions, including the volatility of market prices for shares of technology companies, generally, and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance; and ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#183; the other factors described in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section. ##TABLE_END &#160;\\n\\nThese factors and any corresponding price fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and result in substantial losses by our investors.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nFurther, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in the past. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nPrice volatility of our common stock might be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low. In the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. We have previously been the target of securities litigation and may in the future be subject to additional securities litigation, which could result in substantial costs to us and divert resources and attention of management from our business, even if we are successful in any such litigation. Future sales of our common stock could also reduce the market price of such stock.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nMoreover, the liquidity of our common stock is limited, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but by delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in security analysts&#8217; and the media&#8217;s coverage of us, if any. These factors may result in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and ask prices for our common stock. In addition, without a large float, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock may be more volatile. In the absence of an active public trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate its investment in our common stock. Trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nSales or the availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline and adversely affect our ability to raise capital. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including pursuant to our currently effective Registration Statement on Form S-1, such sales or the anticipation of such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. Such circumstances, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWhen we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, including shares of common stock upon conversion of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or in future financings, it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders and may also result in a reduction in the market price of our common stock. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares of common stock with a $0.00001 par value per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a $0.00001 par value per share, of which, as of December 31, 2019, 8,876,553 shares of common stock and 105,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. Such shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, based upon the applicable conversion rate as of December 31, 2019, were at such time convertible into an aggregate of approximately 295,380 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2019, we also had outstanding warrants and options to purchase an aggregate of 1,389,751 shares of our common stock and unvested, or vested but not yet settled, restricted stock units covering an aggregate of 428,919 shares of common stock. The exercise of such options and warrants and the vesting or vesting and settlement of such restricted stock units would further increase the number of our outstanding shares of common stock.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 25 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nFrom time to time, we may adopt new equity compensation plans or increase the number of shares available for issuance in connection with our existing equity compensation plans. Our board of directors may also choose to issue some or all of our available shares to provide additional financing or acquire businesses in the future.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nThe issuance of any shares upon conversion of any preferred stock, including our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, under our equity compensation plans, for acquisition, licensing or financing efforts, upon exercise of warrants and options, or upon settlement of restricted stock units will dilute the interests of our holders of common stock and cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all then current stockholders. Any such issuances may also result in a reduction in the market price of our common stock.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nThe interests of our controlling stockholders may not coincide with yours and such controlling stockholders may make decisions with which you may disagree. \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nAs of March 13, 2020, four of our stockholders, one of whom is our Executive Chairman and two others of whom are directors, beneficially owned in the aggregate over 50% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. As a result, these stockholders may be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of our company and make some future transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of our controlling stockholders. The interests of our controlling stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have new research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe are subject to financial reporting and other requirements that place significant demands on our resources. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires us to conduct an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational, internal audit and accounting resources. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price. Moreover, effective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. We may also face claims by our investors, which could harm our business and financial condition.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nRisks Relating to Our Charter Documents and Capital Structure \\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nWe are close to being controlled by a small number of &#8220;insider&#8221; stockholders, which could determine corporate and stockholder action on significant matters. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nAs of March 13, 2020, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned an aggregate of 4,494,964 of our outstanding shares of common stock and 71,407 shares of our outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which represents approximately 49% of the aggregate voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. Through their collective ownership of our outstanding stock, such holders, if they were to act together, would be close to controlling the voting of our shares at all meetings of stockholders and, because the common stock does not have cumulative voting rights, to determining the outcome of the election of all of our directors and determining corporate and stockholder action on other matters. The beneficial holdings of our directors and executive officers as a group represent approximately 50% of our shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 26 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or prevent a change in control. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nSome provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws, as well as statutes, may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control. These provisions, including those providing for the possible issuance of shares of our preferred stock, which may be divided into series and with the preferences, limitations and relative rights to be determined by our board of directors, and the right of the board of directors to amend the bylaws, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire a substantial number of shares of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in his or her best interest. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nDelaware law may delay or prevent takeover attempts by third parties and therefore inhibit our stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nWe are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions prevent any stockholder who owns 15% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock from engaging in certain business combinations with us for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder acquired such stock ownership unless certain approvals were or are obtained from our board of directors or from the holders of 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares of common stock (excluding the shares of our common stock owned by the 15% or more stockholder). Our board of directors can use these and other provisions to discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of our company or a change in our management. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or a change in our board of directors or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then current market price of our shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\\n\\n&#160; \\n\\nFailure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nThe success of our future operating activities will depend upon our ability to expand our support system to meet the demands of our growing business. Any failure by our management to effectively anticipate, implement, and manage changes required to sustain our growth would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully operate acquired businesses (if any), become profitable in the future, or effectively manage any other change.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nThe elimination of the monetary liability of our directors under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights held by our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees. \\n\\n&#160;\\n\\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains specific provisions that eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to our company and stockholders and requires indemnification of our directors and officers to the extent provided by Delaware law. Our Bylaws also contain provisions that require the indemnification of our directors, officers and employees. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing limitation of liability and indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our company and our stockholders.\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n##TABLE_START &#160; 27 &#160; ##TABLE_END\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n&#160;\\n\\n\""

            " Item 1. ; Business ##TABLE_END ; ; Overview  ; AudioEye is an industry-leading software solution provider delivering website accessibility compliance at all price points to businesses of all sizes. Our solutions advance accessibility with patented technology that reduces barriers, expands access for individuals with disabilities, and enhances the user experience for a broader audience. We believe that, when implemented, our solution offers businesses and organizations the opportunity to reach more customers, improve brand image, build additional brand loyalty, and, most importantly, provide an accessible and usable web experience to the expansive and ever-growing global population of individuals with disabilities. AudioEye provides an always-on testing, remediation, and monitoring solution that continually improves conformance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), helping businesses and organizations comply with WCAG standards as well as applicable U.S., Canadian, Australian, and United Kingdom accessibility laws. ; AudioEye stands out among its competitors because it delivers machine-learning/artificial intelligence (0;AI1;)-driven accessibility without fundamental changes to the website architecture. Our technology publishes more than one billion remediations daily, and our solution is trusted by some of the largest and most influential companies in the world, including Uber, ADP, Tommy Hilfiger, AMI and more. Government agencies, both at the federal level and state and local levels, have also integrated our software in their digital platforms. ; AudioEye generates revenue through the sale of subscriptions for our software-as-a-service (0;SaaS1;) accessibility solution plans. Plans range in scale from 0;do-it-yourself1; to 0;do-it-for-me.1; All are backed by the power of AudioEye7;s machine-learning/AI-driven technology that finds and fixes the most common accessibility errors. Do-it-yourself plans, AudioEye Starter and Pro, also equip site owners with the remediation tools needed to fix remaining issues, ensuring accessibility standards are met. Do-it-for-me, AudioEye Managed and Enterprise, is for those who want AudioEye to continuously ensure legal compliance and accessibility for users of all abilities. Managed and Enterprise also come with the AudioEye Trusted Certification, our attestation of a site owner7;s commitment to digital inclusion as defined by WCAG success criteria, which mitigates a customer7;s risk of a costly digital accessibility-related legal action. ; AudioEye customers may purchase tiered plans directly through the AudioEye marketplace, in a platform partner marketplace, through a vertical Content Management System (0;CMS1;) authorized reseller, or by working directly with the AudioEye sales team: ; ##TABLE_START ; ; The AudioEye marketplace offers Starter, Pro and Managed plans ideal for customers in any industry and is most effective for sites built on supported CMS platforms; ; ; ; ; ; Certain platforms, such as Duda, natively integrate AudioEye Pro and Managed plans into their marketplace, enabling web creators to immediately build legally compliant, fully accessible websites; ; ; ; ; ; Vertical CMS authorized resellers provide a website-hosting platform for their end-user customers, selling either AudioEye Pro or Managed accessibility solutions; and ; ; ; ; ; Organizations with non-platform custom websites seeking a fully managed solution, engage directly with AudioEye sales personnel for custom pricing and solutions. ##TABLE_END ; ##TABLE_START ; 2 ; ##TABLE_END ; ; Industry Background  ; Millions of Internet users are impacted by disabilities that prevent them from accessing and using digital content on a basis equivalent with those who are not impacted by disabilities. If not coded properly, a website may not offer full functionality for all users, in particular for users of assistive technology (0;AT1;), such as a screen reader. As a result, those sites may exclude potential users and customers. These sites also may not comply with U.S. and foreign laws addressing equal access and digital inclusion. ; Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act was enacted to help eliminate barriers to access. Just as building owners must implement physical accommodations to remove any physical barrier to access, transportation, or communication, website owners must adhere to Web Accessibility best practices in order to ensure barrier-free access to their websites and online materials. Over time, a website owner must maintain and prove its implementation of those techniques, such as those outlined within the globally recognized WCAG. ; Traditional solutions addressing web accessibility may be costly and difficult to implement. Historically, the process for achieving compliance has been driven by costly consulting services and has not fully utilized emerging technologies to reduce the compliance cost burden. At the same time, web accessibility efforts have generally focused on a limited number of disability use cases, leaving many users7; accessibility needs for digital inclusion unaddressed. Businesses may have been reluctant to invest further in web accessibility solutions due to a perceived lack of commercial return on the significant investment required to design and implement a thorough and usable compliance solution. ; Conventional solutions have been developed to help users access websites, but these systems often require the installation of a plug-in or software on the user7;s computer. Many of these solutions are tailored to either single or a limited number of use cases and do not encompass a more holistic approach for addressing a wider range of use cases. In some cases, these systems can be costly, unwieldy and inconvenient. Furthermore, the assistive software7;s ability to understand, process, and interpret complex and dynamic web applications that are prevalent across the web today is dependent on the quality with which the code was designed and developed, including the level to which the website adheres to best practices and standards. ; AudioEye7;s proprietary technology and processes remove the compliance cost burden for companies and website developers. Our machine-learning technology immediately identifies and fixes the most common accessibility errors, billions of issues daily, and addresses a wide range of disabilities including dyslexia, color blindness, epilepsy and more. And with the rapid acceleration of AudioEye on CMS templates, our technology advances in its recognition of errors, creating and pushing custom platform-level remediations. By working with strategically identified resellers and platform providers, AudioEye is able to onboard more end-user customers in a shorter period of time, leveraging economies of scale to deliver its solution in a cost-effective and highly efficient way. This strategy continues to make accessibility available to companies that would otherwise neglect the important issue of digital inclusion altogether. ; ##TABLE_START ; 3 ; ##TABLE_END ; ; Intellectual Property  ; Our intellectual property is primarily comprised of trade secrets, trademarks, issued, published and pending patent applications, copyrights and technological innovation. We have a patent portfolio comprised of eight issued patents in the United States. We also have two pending patent applications and two international patent applications filed via the Patent Cooperation Treaty (0;PCT1;) and the European Patent Office. ; We have a trademark portfolio comprised of eight United States trademark registrations. ; Our current patented inventions relate to: ; ##TABLE_START ; ; A server-side method and apparatus that enables users to audibly navigate websites and hear high-quality streaming audio narration and descriptions of websites. This patented invention involves creating an audio-enabled web experience by utilizing voice talent and automated text-to-speech conversion methods to read and describe web content. ##TABLE_END ; ##TABLE_START ; ; Systems for automatic remediation of non-compliant webpages and user interfaces using pre-stored remediation scripts as well as form-based quickfix remediation codes. More specifically, this patent covers various features related to crawling webpages and user interfaces to perform compliance assessments using pre-stored remediation scripts corresponding to different compliance issues and manipulating the document object model (DOM). This patent also covers various features related to using pre-stored accelerated remediation code blocks, including those derived from machine learning, corresponding to different compliance issues to modify the DOM. ##TABLE_END ; ##TABLE_START ; ; Methods for providing alternative descriptions to elements on a webpage that were previously untagged and without the appropriate tags. More specifically, this patent covers various features related to detecting an untagged element having an associated hyperlink and using pre-existing remediation scripts to assign an alt text description to the untagged element. In addition, this patent also covers various features related to detecting an untagged image and assigning an alt text description based on image recognition analysis. ##TABLE_END ; Our current portfolio has established a foundation for building unique technology solutions that contribute to the way in which we differentiate ourselves from other competitors in the B2B Web Accessibility marketplace. We plan to continue to invest in research and development and expand our portfolio of proprietary intellectual property. ; ##TABLE_START ; 4 ; ##TABLE_END ; ; Business Plan and Strategy  ; Leveraging our own patented platform, we provide cloud-based, enterprise-grade technology solutions in conjunction with managed services as/when needed, to fully implement our solution and position our clients7; sites to more fully conform with web accessibility best practices. Our technology solution and service offerings may be purchased through a subscription service for either a month (exclusive for Small &#38; Medium sized businesses), or a one-year or multi-year term (available for both Small &#38; Medium sized businesses as well as Enterprise customers). ; Through the sale of managed and self-service contracts, our business model is to sell Business to Business and to secure revenue from multiple business channels, including (but not limited to): providers of CMS, corporate website owners, publishers, web designers, developers and operators, federal, state and local governments, educational institutions, e-learning and e-commerce websites, and not-for-profit organizations. ; In what Forrester Research, Inc., a market research company that provides advice on existing and potential impact of technology, has called the 0;age of the customer,1; we believe that, by adopting our solutions, our customers gain a competitive advantage by ensuring a superior digital experience for all of their own customers, and in particular for persons with diverse abilities. Some of the many leading advantages of our solution include: ; ##TABLE_START ; 1. Maintaining a mission of inclusion and accessibility for the approximately 15% of the population with a disability or physical limitation who are denied full access to online digital content; ; ; ; ; 2. Increasing the client return on investment by opening access to the spending power of the approximately 15% of the population that is denied equal access to the internet; ; ; ; ; 3. Maximizing conformance with WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria; ; ; ; ; 4. Deploying a cost-effective2;platform-wide and fully-managed, as applicable2;solution that is scalable with rapid deployment and little to no project management; ; ; ; ; 5. Consistently providing an enhanced customer experience for our client customers by providing access to innovative and universally designed technology solutions; ##TABLE_END ; Our primary objective is to establish and maintain a long-standing relationship with our customers, as a trusted and reliable provider of web accessibility technology and services. ; From an operational perspective and to enable us to deliver on our objective, the business is organized functionally into Executive &#38; Administration, Sales, Marketing, Product development, Engineering (which includes intellectual property development), Implementation, Quality Assurance, and Customer Experience teams. Intellectual property development is tasked with the development of new leading-edge intellectual property. ; ##TABLE_START ; 5 ; ##TABLE_END ; ; Product Service Offerings  ;  As the leading provider of SaaS-based digital content accessibility solutions, AudioEye7;s mission is to eradicate all barriers to digital accessibility. ; With our flagship fully managed service, AudioEye Managed, AudioEye has historically focused on providing a custom accessibility solution for enterprise-level organizations. In November 2019, AudioEye expanded its solutions suite, launching a digital marketplace with plans more amenable, and more affordable, to small and medium-sized businesses. The launch of the digital marketplace has better positioned AudioEye to significantly expand its market share, now serving businesses and organizations of all sizes at all price points. ; With the launch of the AudioEye digital marketplace, every audioeye.com visitor can now also request and receive a free website accessibility scan. By providing a URL and email address, this scan audits a sample of a visitor7;s site, identifying a point-in-time list of WCAG errors and risks. While other providers charge for a site audit, AudioEye7;s scan is free. ; Every AudioEye plan enables users to fully achieve WCAG compliance, whether customers do the bulk of the work themselves, utilize AudioEye7;s tools and technology to identify and resolve issues together with AudioEye, or fully outsource the work to our experts: ; ##TABLE_START ; ; AudioEye Starter : Website owners may accelerate digital accessibility easily and affordably with AudioEye Starter. Upon installing the AudioEye JavaScript, this free product provides users access to a comprehensive site accessibility report, identifying all WCAG risks and errors, as well as access to AudioEye7;s free, on-site developer tools. These are the same tools AudioEye experts use to identify and resolve accessibility errors. Starter is best for customers who wish to manage accessibility on their own, utilizing AudioEye7;s reporting and developer tools to achieve full compliance. Do it yourself digital accessibility. ##TABLE_END ; ##TABLE_START ; ; AudioEye Pro : Ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, AudioEye Pro customers receive access to AudioEye7;s on-site developer tools as well as more robust WCAG accessibility reports. Further, upon installing the AudioEye JavaScript, AudioEye7;s always-on, proprietary machine-learning/AI-driven technology is automatically identifying and resolving approximately 35% of the most common WCAG accessibility errors. Pro customers may then utilize AudioEye7;s developer tools to resolve the remaining errors. AudioEye Pro customers receive the AudioEye Accessibility Toolbar, which includes website personalization tools for end users, as well as a 24/7 Help Desk for users to report any accessibility-related issues. Pro customers receive an accessibility statement, articulating their commitment to an accessible user experience, as well as access to a library of on-demand digital accessibility training resources. Do it together digital accessibility. ##TABLE_END ; ##TABLE_START ; ; AudioEye Managed : AudioEye Managed is ideal for those customers interested in completely outsourcing digital accessibility compliance. Upon installing the AudioEye JavaScript, AudioEye Managed customers benefit from AudioEye7;s always-on, proprietary machine-learning/AI-driven technology automatically identifying and resolving the most common WCAG accessibility errors (approximately 35-percent) coupled with AudioEye7;s team of digital accessibility subject matter experts monitoring, manually testing and resolving the remaining errors. This team utilizes the most common assistive technologies on the most common website browsers to ensure site-specific errors are resolved. Managed customers receive the full AudioEye Accessibility Toolbar, including a 24/7 Help Desk, access to a library of on-demand digital accessibility training resources as well as invitations to live, quarterly training sessions. Unlike any solution on the market, AudioEye provides its Managed customers a public Certification Statement, which is AudioEye7;s attestation of a site7;s WCAG compliance. Managed customers also receive a Sustainable Testing &#38; Remediation Plan in the event they are facing legal action. Do it for me digital accessibility. AudioEye Managed is priced according to a site7;s complexity and is designed not only for small and medium-sized businesses on CMS platforms but also for enterprises with customized websites. ##TABLE_END ; ##TABLE_START ; 6 ; ##TABLE_END ; ; AudioEye continues to offer other digital accessibility solutions for both dynamic and static documents (PDFs) as well as mobile applications. ; Customers  ; Our potential customer base includes a very broad range of private and public sector customers, including: ; ##TABLE_START ; ; Small &#38; Medium sized businesses, ##TABLE_END ; ##TABLE_START ; ; Corporate enterprises, ##TABLE_END ; ##TABLE_START ; ; Federal, state, and local governments and agencies, ##TABLE_END ; The Company had one major customer (including such customer7;s affiliates) which accounted for approximately 10% of its revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company had one major customer which generated approximately 11.8% of its revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. ; Small &#38; Medium sized customers  ;  We have recently expanded our offerings via our Marketplace and via partnerships with Duda to capture a much larger market of Small &#38; Medium sized customers. ; Our solutions are sold by our partnership sales team through strategic partnerships, resellers and via our eCommerce platform (Marketplace). This strategy enables us to address all the broad markets covered by our technology and allows for a depth and market penetration that we could never approach on our own. ; Our CMS platform partners and resellers are critical for us to reach this customer segment to both penetrate deeper and more broadly (into multiple industry verticals) by partnering with us to spread awareness and offer a unique solution to make their digital content &#38; websites accessible. ; Corporate Enterprises  ; Corporate Enterprises are larger customers who are served through our enterprise sales team. These companies tend to have more complicated and customized websites that need a deeper resolution to ensure they are compliant with WCAG guidelines. We serve them through multiple offerings. Our Managed services is the biggest part of that offering-set. We also offer PDF remediation and MobileApp guide solutions for them. We believe that the AudioEye products provides a business advantage for our clients by enabling them to better reach the large population of customers who are not able to gain equal access to our clients7; content, products, and services delivered via their websites ; Government and Not-for-Profit Organizations  ; Federal and state laws require that the information and services made available across government agency websites meet the diverse and unique needs of all site visitors. Conforming to Web Accessibility best practices and guidelines helps ensure public access to government information and improves the value of agency investment in their websites and online services. ; The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (0;Rehabilitation Act1;) requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a federal department or agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public without disabilities. The federal government also requires vendors selling to the government to be compliant under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, unless covered by a provable exception. Canada and the European Union have similar requirements. ; Seniors and print-impaired individuals need the Internet7;s critical access to fundamental state, local and federal government services and information such as tax forms, social programs, emergency services and legislative representatives. In addition, the roughly 120,000 federal employees with disabilities require Internet accessibility for workplace productivity. The AudioEye Reader in the cloud provides an intuitive Internet experience across all Internet-enabled devices without imposing any additional costs on end-users. For government site administrators, our Digital Accessibility Platform is designed to be user-friendly so that sites can be made accessible and maintained as part of any web management process.  ; ##TABLE_START ; 7 ; ##TABLE_END ; ; Over 100 governments have signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Company7;s certification seal demonstrates a website owner7;s commitment to meeting internationally accepted accessibility standards. As a result, our management believes that providing accessibility services for website owners and developers has become a significant market opportunity in view of the potential demand across millions of internet websites. ; The AudioEye solution provides a unique approach to solving a pervasive issue that has inhibited government agencies from embracing efficiencies gained through adopting new cost-effective technological capabilities. More and more federal agencies are beginning to embrace cloud-based service offerings and to leverage the capabilities afforded through the adoption of third-party cloud-based service providers. Implementing the AudioEye solution allows federal, state, and local governments to provide constituents with a reliable, scalable, and fully accessible web environment. By pairing the AudioEye Solution with other disparate SaaS offerings, organizations can more readily comply with the ADA standards. Implementing AudioEye mitigates risk of non-conformance and goes beyond basic levels of compliance through the inclusion of free cloud-based assistive tools, which lives up to the spirit of ADA - a noble and necessary aspiration for all federal, state and local government agencies. ; Our solutions are sold by our enterprise sales team and through strategic partnerships and resellers. This strategy enables us to address all the broad markets covered by our technology and allows for a depth and market penetration that we could never approach on our own. ; Our management believes that the government market imposes certain barriers to entry to new potential entrants. However, our management believes that the potential for recurring revenue generation, the data value appreciation that occurs over time, and low turnover upon establishment of government business all contribute to ideal long-term conditions that make this a good market for us to conduct direct sales. ; The federal government boasts nearly 2,000 top-level .gov domains and 24,000 websites of varying purpose, design, navigation, usability and accessibility. Including the 50 states and all local government websites, there are over 600,000 government websites in the United States. ; Potential additional market segments or verticals of focus include, but are not limited to: ; ##TABLE_START ; ; Finance &#38; Banking Institutions; ; ; ; ; ; Travel &#38; Hospitality; ; ; ; ; ; Public &#38; Private Transportation Companies; ; ; ; ; ; Retail and Ecommerce Companies; ; ; ; ; ; Educational Institutions (K-12 and universities as a result of frequent and recent settlement agreements involving and structured by the Department of Justice); ; ; ; ; ; Food Services; and ; ; ; ; ; SaaS Providers. ##TABLE_END ; Marketing and Sales  ; In addition to our enterprise sales team, we use strategic business partnerships and development referral partners, for introductions to C-level executives and key stakeholders that directly influence the buying decision of our technology and services. Success in all these efforts is not only critical in order to meet our sales objectives, but also raises market awareness of the Company7;s products and brand. ; ##TABLE_START ; 8 ; ##TABLE_END ; ; We also have a Partnership sales team that focuses on building and maintaining relationships with CMS providers focused on either specific verticals (e.g. Dealer.com) or who are vertical agnostic (e.g. Duda). ; Our increased focus is now to further strengthen our digital marketing by enhancing the content we share with potential customers and by also ensuring that our Brand image continues to improve as we satisfy our customers and expand our reach and market share in this growing space. ; The Company also attends selected accessibility and industry trade conferences, maintains memberships with key, industry-specific organizations, serves as a subject matter expert within well-attended panels covering industry-related topics, leverages paid search engine optimization for those looking online to learn about or purchase accessibility products or services, and a variety of other conventional marketing and social marketing techniques. ; Competition  ; Website accessibility can be achieved in one of two ways. ; The traditional approach is called a 0;Shift Left1; strategy. On the continuum of an organization7;s software development life cycle, shift left refers to integrating universal design and accessibility testing and analysis as early on in a project (the design and development process) as possible. The idea is to prohibit inaccessible content from reaching production environments . For many businesses and organizations with the right resources and afforded a healthy amount of time, this is absolutely the right thing to do. Without a doubt, websites should be designed, developed, and created with web accessibility in mind. This is why AudioEye offers the Digital Accessibility Platform and provides resources for organizations seeking to empower internal stakeholders to become the subject matter experts. This approach, however, does little to assist organizations being sued based on websites that are already live and public facing. No one has ever been sued for a website that was being built. By the thousands, per year, businesses are being sued because of the sites they have, today, and not the sites they are looking to build in the future. ; AudioEye makes websites accessible. Our solution identifies and remediates accessibility issues with both automated and manual testing and engineering and provides on-going monitoring to ensure sites meet or exceed legal compliance with ADA-related laws and substantially conform with the WCAG, which is the internationally recognized benchmark used to ensure the needs of individuals of disabilities are addressed when it comes to creating and publishing websites and digital content. ; We believe that other competitive solutions are insufficient when it comes to actually achieving substantial conformance with WCAG and removing access barriers that may impede or limit access for individuals with disabilities. These other solutions include: ; ##TABLE_START ; ; Automated Testing Tools. These tools are insufficient and not always a viable solution. There are a vast number of automated testing tools. These solutions provide businesses that tend to have very little knowledge of the issues with insights into, approximately, 35% of the overall potential access barriers. Unfortunately, they do not assist businesses in understanding true access barriers and may even provide misleading evidence (e.g. false positives) that further delay product stakeholders time (assuming the business even controls its website 1; i.e. many businesses rely on outsourced niche CMS providers, which leaves their hands tied when it comes to meeting compliance requirements). At the very best, these tools offer potential insight to assist internal stakeholders with information as to how to find and potentially fix, up to only 35% of the issues that are detected by the automated testing suite. The remaining issues require subject matter experts to uncover issues through manual accessibility (AT) testing. ; ; ; ; ; Accessibility Toolbars. These tools are insufficient and not a viable solution by themselves. For as many automated testing tools that can be found in the marketplace, there are just about as many low-cost accessibility toolbars, many of which emulate the leading edge, industry-first web personalization tools that AudioEye supplies free with the Managed Service. On their own, these solutions provide businesses with only incremental benefits that address a small percentage of potential access barriers. Automatic remediation (if any) narrowly addresses WCAG Success Criteria, which provides very little benefit for AT users, who are the ones filing lawsuits against businesses for non-compliance. This approach has worked well in countries outside of the U.S. as evidenced by the large number of international firms attempting to enter the market in the U.S. Until these tool providers achieve validation from U.S.-based security organizations and can pass stringent due diligence examinations, they face an uphill climb. Further, and more importantly, until these tool providers are able to securely and reliably deliver human-based remediation as delivered through their dynamic remediation technology, U.S. companies will gain limited benefit by incorporating and using these highly limited solutions. ##TABLE_END ; ##TABLE_START ; 9 ; ##TABLE_END ; ; In summary, our management believes that the Company7;s technology and solutions will primarily compete against the following: ; ##TABLE_START ; 1. Web Accessibility Assessment Technology Providers and Automated Testing Tools. There are a small number of Web Accessibility audit and tracking platform providers, but we do not believe their technology solutions offer the specific end-to-end services offered through the AudioEye Digital Accessibility Platform. Furthermore, their solutions are currently more standalone in that, unlike the Company, they are not combined with a cloud-based tool with a full suite of assistive tools for end-users. ; ; ; ; 2. Web Accessibility Remediation Technology Providers. Currently, other technology providers that utilize technology to apply compliance remediation through a server-side technology do not effectively deploy human-based remediations, nor do they pair their solution with the full breadth of services offered through the AudioEye Managed Platform product suite, including, for example, assistive tools for end-users. These providers are therefore limited in their capacity to provide a fully inclusive user experience for the customers adopting the technology. ; ; ; ; 3. Web Accessibility Consulting Service Providers. There are a substantial number of consulting service providers in the Web Accessibility industry. Each generally provides an analysis of the various compliance issues associated with its clients7; websites. They ultimately provide resources and assistance in applying fixes and changes at the source. While we provide these services, we also provide tools that empower an end-to-end fully managed service, as well as tools that empower self-directed developers to fix issues without requiring source-code remediation. ; ; ; ; 4. Cloud-Based Assistive Technology Providers and Accessibility Toolbars. There are other cloud-based assistive technology providers. However, they do not offer a reliable and trusted solution with compliance detection and remediation for users of existing, native assistive technologies, such as screen readers. ##TABLE_END ;  ##TABLE_START ; 10 ; ##TABLE_END ; ; Competitive Strengths  ; Our management believes the following competitive strengths will enable our success in the marketplace: ; ##TABLE_START ; ; Unique patented technology . First and foremost, AudioEye builds all its products with the primary goal of enhancing the user experience, in every way possible, regardless of the end-user7;s individual disability or physical limitation. AudioEye is a marketplace technology leader providing what we believe to be unparalleled Web Accessibility solutions for our clients7; customers through our Managed Platform products . We own a unique patent portfolio comprised of six issued patents in the United States and we have additional U.S. patents pending. Our portfolio includes patents and pending patent applications in the United States with over 60 issued claims. ##TABLE_END ; ##TABLE_START ; ; Freemium model. A Freemium model that enables all website owners to leverage our free tools as well as very reasonably priced offerings all the way to our customized enterprise grade solutions. We believe that having a full-suite of offerings is a competitive differentiator for AudioEye, but the Company must continue to try and differentiate our offerings from a growing list of companies competing in various ways. ##TABLE_END ; ##TABLE_START ; ; Unique combination of technology and specialized managed service . Our management believes that AudioEye has addressed the problem of Web Accessibility, holistically, and provides a combination of leading-edge technology and high-quality specialized managed service. Our combined solution is designed to provide our clients with access and usability across their digital infrastructure, and to lead to cost-savings and reduced time-to-market for our customers. Our management believes that the AudioEye solution allows our customers to focus not only on achieving compliance, but also on maintaining compliance throughout the life of the subscription. ##TABLE_END ; Our current portfolio has established a foundation for building unique technology solutions that contribute to the way in which we differentiate ourselves from other competitors in the B2B Web Accessibility marketplace. In this continued pursuit of expanding the capabilities of our technology and meeting the demands of our customers, AudioEye is committed to growing its IP portfolio. ; ##TABLE_START ; ; Highly experienced inventors, technologists and product development team . Our team is comprised of experienced software, e-commerce, mobile marketing and Internet developers and technologists that have worked together for over fifteen years. During their careers, this team has developed several technologies programs for Fortune 500 organizations; federal, state and local governments in the United States, and several leading organizations across the global marketplace. ##TABLE_END ; Patent and Trademark Rights  ; Our intellectual property is primarily comprised of trade secrets, trademarks, issued, published and pending patent applications, copyrights and technological innovation. We have a patent portfolio comprised of eight issued patents in the United States. We also have two pending patent applications and two international patent applications filed via the Patent Cooperation Treaty (0;PCT1;). The patents have been extended and cover a period from 2002 through 2038. ; We have eight registered trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The commercial value of these patents is unknown. ; ##TABLE_START ; 11 ; ##TABLE_END ; ; Legal Landscape and Government Regulation  ; Government regulation in the United States that affects the market and commercial potential for our products and services includes the Rehabilitation Act, the ADA, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 (0;CVAA1;), the Air Carrier Accessibility Act (0;ACAA1;), and various State Laws. ; The Rehabilitation Act requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a federal department or agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public without disabilities. The federal government also requires vendors selling to the government be compliant under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, unless covered by a provable exception. Canada and the European Union have similar requirements. ; The ADA was passed to ensure equal opportunity for people with disabilities. It applies to employment, transportation, state and local government services, and businesses that provide public accommodations or facilities. ; Title II and Title III of the ADA prevent discrimination on the basis of disability in services, programs, and activities provided by public entities (Title II) and private entities considered to be places of public accommodation (Title III). Title II and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act continue to be actively enforced by the Office of Civil Rights (0;OCR1;), who has entered into hundreds of resolution agreements with School Districts and Education Institutions requiring conformance to WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria as managed and monitored through an OCR-validated Accessibility Auditor. ; Under the previous administration, the Department of Justice (0;DOJ1;) was in the process of formulating rules regarding the accessibility of websites and mobile applications. The DOJ had divided its rulemaking into two efforts: the first was intended to provide guidance to state and local entities to comply with Title II, and the second was intended to establish rules for private entities to comply with Title III. Under the new administration, the DOJ has placed the issuance of those rulemakings on the inactive list. However, we believe the absence of any rulemaking will only increase the prevalence of lawsuits filed by plaintiffs seeking issue resolution in continued pursuit of their civil rights as protected under ADA. According to a leading ADA law firm, Seyfarth Shaw, with over 2,258 federal lawsuits filed, federal ADA Title III lawsuits increased by 17% in 2018 due largely to Website Access Lawsuits. This trend is expected to increase in 2020. ; Learn more at www.ada.gov . ; Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Requires that federal agencies7; electronic and information technology is accessible to people with disabilities, including employees and the public. ; The U.S. Government Access Board has updated the requirements to Section 508 compliance standards, commonly referred to as the 0;Section 508 ICT Refresh,1; further formalizing the mandate to adhere to specific web accessibility best practices, namely those outlined under the WCAG, the international standards for web accessibility. Already, a growing number of legal mandates and recent settlements point to the WCAG 2.1 standards as well as making it a requirement to hire third-party Accessibility Subject Matter Experts to maintain an accessibility audit and provide certification 1; sources range from the DOJ, the U.S. Access Board, and the OCR. ; For more information, visit www.section508.gov . ; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act entitles individuals with disabilities to equal access to any program or activity that receives federal subsidy 1; this includes Web-based communications for educational institutions and government agencies. ; In October 2010, the CVAA was enacted to update existing federal laws requiring communications and video programming accessibility and to fill in any current gaps in accessibility to ensure the full inclusion of people with disabilities in all aspects of daily living through accessible, affordable and usable communication and video programming technologies. ; ##TABLE_START ; 12 ; ##TABLE_END ; ; Per the Department of Transportation, the ACAA (49 U.S.C. 41705) prohibits discrimination by U.S. and foreign air carriers on the basis of physical or mental disability. The Department of Transportation, in interpreting and implementing the ACAA, has issued a rule setting forth the standards of service which air carriers are expected to provide to disabled individuals. ; Beyond the federal level, many states have enacted accessibility laws and, going further, internationally, over 100 Governments have signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. ; As an example, the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, among other things, prohibits discrimination based on disability. More recently, a new law enacted in California, Assembly Bill 434 State Web Accessibility, states that prior to July 1, 2019, each State Agency Director or its Chief Information Officer must post on the homepage of its agency a declaration that the site has been made accessible by meeting the WCAG standards. ; Given the many government regulations in place and/or in process, actions must be taken for businesses to comply with best practices and international standards. This presents a significant business opportunity as more pressure is being put on businesses and organizations to improve the accessibility of their web environments. In addition, from a risk mitigation standpoint, it is best if they consistently and reliably track and demonstrate their level of conformance to these internationally recognized standards over time, the WCAG 2.1. ; Disabilities advocates won a major victory recently after the U.S. Supreme Court left in place an appeals court ruling arguing that Domino7;s website and app must abide by the same rules of accessibility as brick-and-mortar shops. The top court refused to hear a federal appeals court ruling that Domino7;s website and app have to follow Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations and be accessible to people with visual or other impairments. The decision could have broad implications for the restaurant industry, in particular. Chains such as Domino7;s are taking a lot more orders through their website and smartphone apps, making them key places of doing business. The ruling suggests restaurants could be subject to ADA lawsuits if that ordering technology isn7;t accessible to people with disabilities. The case is one of several that disabilities advocates have filed against companies7; websites, seeking to push them to comply with federal accessibilities regulations. ; Employees  ; As of March 30, 2020, we had 84 full-time employees. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that relations with our employees are very good. We have a sincere focus on developing each team member to allow the team member to grow professionally and personally during his or her time with AudioEye.  ; Corporate Information  ; AudioEye, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation on May 20, 2005. On August 1, 2018, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to implement a reverse stock split in the ratio of 1 share for every 25 shares of common stock and to reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock from 250,000,000 to 50,000,000. As a result, 186,994,384 shares of the Company7;s common stock were exchanged for 7,479,775 shares of the Company's common stock. Our financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split. ; Our principal executive offices are located at 5210 East Williams Circle, Suite 750, Tucson Arizona, 85711, and our telephone number at that address is (866) 331-5324.

            " Item 1. ; Business  ; ; Overview  ; AudioEye is an industry-leading software solution provider delivering website accessibility compliance at all price points to businesses of all sizes. Our solutions advance accessibility with patented technology that reduces barriers, expands access for individuals with disabilities, and enhances the user experience for a broader audience. We believe that, when implemented, our solution offers businesses and organizations the opportunity to reach more customers, improve brand image, build additional brand loyalty, and, most importantly, provide an accessible and usable web experience to the expansive and ever-growing global population of individuals with disabilities. AudioEye provides an always-on testing, remediation, and monitoring solution that continually improves conformance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), helping businesses and organizations comply with WCAG standards as well as applicable U.S., Canadian, Australian, and United Kingdom accessibility laws. ; AudioEye stands out among its competitors because it delivers machine-learning/artificial intelligence (0;AI1;)-driven accessibility without fundamental changes to the website architecture. Our technology publishes more than one billion remediations daily, and our solution is trusted by some of the largest and most influential companies in the world, including Uber, ADP, Tommy Hilfiger, AMI and more. Government agencies, both at the federal level and state and local levels, have also integrated our software in their digital platforms. ; AudioEye generates revenue through the sale of subscriptions for our software-as-a-service (0;SaaS1;) accessibility solution plans. Plans range in scale from 0;do-it-yourself1; to 0;do-it-for-me.1; All are backed by the power of AudioEye7;s machine-learning/AI-driven technology that finds and fixes the most common accessibility errors. Do-it-yourself plans, AudioEye Starter and Pro, also equip site owners with the remediation tools needed to fix remaining issues, ensuring accessibility standards are met. Do-it-for-me, AudioEye Managed and Enterprise, is for those who want AudioEye to continuously ensure legal compliance and accessibility for users of all abilities. Managed and Enterprise also come with the AudioEye Trusted Certification, our attestation of a site owner7;s commitment to digital inclusion as defined by WCAG success criteria, which mitigates a customer7;s risk of a costly digital accessibility-related legal action. ; AudioEye customers may purchase tiered plans directly through the AudioEye marketplace, in a platform partner marketplace, through a vertical Content Management System (0;CMS1;) authorized reseller, or by working directly with the AudioEye sales team: ;  ; ; The AudioEye marketplace offers Starter, Pro and Managed plans ideal for customers in any industry and is most effective for sites built on supported CMS platforms; ; ; ; ; ; Certain platforms, such as Duda, natively integrate AudioEye Pro and Managed plans into their marketplace, enabling web creators to immediately build legally compliant, fully accessible websites; ; ; ; ; ; Vertical CMS authorized resellers provide a website-hosting platform for their end-user customers, selling either AudioEye Pro or Managed accessibility solutions; and ; ; ; ; ; Organizations with non-platform custom websites seeking a fully managed solution, engage directly with AudioEye sales personnel for custom pricing and solutions.  ;  ; 2 ;  ; ; Industry Background  ; Millions of Internet users are impacted by disabilities that prevent them from accessing and using digital content on a basis equivalent with those who are not impacted by disabilities. If not coded properly, a website may not offer full functionality for all users, in particular for users of assistive technology (0;AT1;), such as a screen reader. As a result, those sites may exclude potential users and customers. These sites also may not comply with U.S. and foreign laws addressing equal access and digital inclusion. ; Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act was enacted to help eliminate barriers to access. Just as building owners must implement physical accommodations to remove any physical barrier to access, transportation, or communication, website owners must adhere to Web Accessibility best practices in order to ensure barrier-free access to their websites and online materials. Over time, a website owner must maintain and prove its implementation of those techniques, such as those outlined within the globally recognized WCAG. ; Traditional solutions addressing web accessibility may be costly and difficult to implement. Historically, the process for achieving compliance has been driven by costly consulting services and has not fully utilized emerging technologies to reduce the compliance cost burden. At the same time, web accessibility efforts have generally focused on a limited number of disability use cases, leaving many users7; accessibility needs for digital inclusion unaddressed. Businesses may have been reluctant to invest further in web accessibility solutions due to a perceived lack of commercial return on the significant investment required to design and implement a thorough and usable compliance solution. ; Conventional solutions have been developed to help users access websites, but these systems often require the installation of a plug-in or software on the user7;s computer. Many of these solutions are tailored to either single or a limited number of use cases and do not encompass a more holistic approach for addressing a wider range of use cases. In some cases, these systems can be costly, unwieldy and inconvenient. Furthermore, the assistive software7;s ability to understand, process, and interpret complex and dynamic web applications that are prevalent across the web today is dependent on the quality with which the code was designed and developed, including the level to which the website adheres to best practices and standards. ; AudioEye7;s proprietary technology and processes remove the compliance cost burden for companies and website developers. Our machine-learning technology immediately identifies and fixes the most common accessibility errors, billions of issues daily, and addresses a wide range of disabilities including dyslexia, color blindness, epilepsy and more. And with the rapid acceleration of AudioEye on CMS templates, our technology advances in its recognition of errors, creating and pushing custom platform-level remediations. By working with strategically identified resellers and platform providers, AudioEye is able to onboard more end-user customers in a shorter period of time, leveraging economies of scale to deliver its solution in a cost-effective and highly efficient way. This strategy continues to make accessibility available to companies that would otherwise neglect the important issue of digital inclusion altogether. ;  ; 3 ;  ; ; Intellectual Property  ; Our intellectual property is primarily comprised of trade secrets, trademarks, issued, published and pending patent applications, copyrights and technological innovation. We have a patent portfolio comprised of eight issued patents in the United States. We also have two pending patent applications and two international patent applications filed via the Patent Cooperation Treaty (0;PCT1;) and the European Patent Office. ; We have a trademark portfolio comprised of eight United States trademark registrations. ; Our current patented inventions relate to: ;  ; ; A server-side method and apparatus that enables users to audibly navigate websites and hear high-quality streaming audio narration and descriptions of websites. This patented invention involves creating an audio-enabled web experience by utilizing voice talent and automated text-to-speech conversion methods to read and describe web content.  ;  ; ; Systems for automatic remediation of non-compliant webpages and user interfaces using pre-stored remediation scripts as well as form-based quickfix remediation codes. More specifically, this patent covers various features related to crawling webpages and user interfaces to perform compliance assessments using pre-stored remediation scripts corresponding to different compliance issues and manipulating the document object model (DOM). This patent also covers various features related to using pre-stored accelerated remediation code blocks, including those derived from machine learning, corresponding to different compliance issues to modify the DOM.  ;  ; ; Methods for providing alternative descriptions to elements on a webpage that were previously untagged and without the appropriate tags. More specifically, this patent covers various features related to detecting an untagged element having an associated hyperlink and using pre-existing remediation scripts to assign an alt text description to the untagged element. In addition, this patent also covers various features related to detecting an untagged image and assigning an alt text description based on image recognition analysis.  ; Our current portfolio has established a foundation for building unique technology solutions that contribute to the way in which we differentiate ourselves from other competitors in the B2B Web Accessibility marketplace. We plan to continue to invest in research and development and expand our portfolio of proprietary intellectual property. ;  ; 4 ;  ; ; Business Plan and Strategy  ; Leveraging our own patented platform, we provide cloud-based, enterprise-grade technology solutions in conjunction with managed services as/when needed, to fully implement our solution and position our clients7; sites to more fully conform with web accessibility best practices. Our technology solution and service offerings may be purchased through a subscription service for either a month (exclusive for Small &#38; Medium sized businesses), or a one-year or multi-year term (available for both Small &#38; Medium sized businesses as well as Enterprise customers). ; Through the sale of managed and self-service contracts, our business model is to sell Business to Business and to secure revenue from multiple business channels, including (but not limited to): providers of CMS, corporate website owners, publishers, web designers, developers and operators, federal, state and local governments, educational institutions, e-learning and e-commerce websites, and not-for-profit organizations. ; In what Forrester Research, Inc., a market research company that provides advice on existing and potential impact of technology, has called the 0;age of the customer,1; we believe that, by adopting our solutions, our customers gain a competitive advantage by ensuring a superior digital experience for all of their own customers, and in particular for persons with diverse abilities. Some of the many leading advantages of our solution include: ;  ; 1. Maintaining a mission of inclusion and accessibility for the approximately 15% of the population with a disability or physical limitation who are denied full access to online digital content; ; ; ; ; 2. Increasing the client return on investment by opening access to the spending power of the approximately 15% of the population that is denied equal access to the internet; ; ; ; ; 3. Maximizing conformance with WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria; ; ; ; ; 4. Deploying a cost-effective2;platform-wide and fully-managed, as applicable2;solution that is scalable with rapid deployment and little to no project management; ; ; ; ; 5. Consistently providing an enhanced customer experience for our client customers by providing access to innovative and universally designed technology solutions;  ; Our primary objective is to establish and maintain a long-standing relationship with our customers, as a trusted and reliable provider of web accessibility technology and services. ; From an operational perspective and to enable us to deliver on our objective, the business is organized functionally into Executive &#38; Administration, Sales, Marketing, Product development, Engineering (which includes intellectual property development), Implementation, Quality Assurance, and Customer Experience teams. Intellectual property development is tasked with the development of new leading-edge intellectual property. ;  ; 5 ;  ; ; Product Service Offerings  ;  As the leading provider of SaaS-based digital content accessibility solutions, AudioEye7;s mission is to eradicate all barriers to digital accessibility. ; With our flagship fully managed service, AudioEye Managed, AudioEye has historically focused on providing a custom accessibility solution for enterprise-level organizations. In November 2019, AudioEye expanded its solutions suite, launching a digital marketplace with plans more amenable, and more affordable, to small and medium-sized businesses. The launch of the digital marketplace has better positioned AudioEye to significantly expand its market share, now serving businesses and organizations of all sizes at all price points. ; With the launch of the AudioEye digital marketplace, every audioeye.com visitor can now also request and receive a free website accessibility scan. By providing a URL and email address, this scan audits a sample of a visitor7;s site, identifying a point-in-time list of WCAG errors and risks. While other providers charge for a site audit, AudioEye7;s scan is free. ; Every AudioEye plan enables users to fully achieve WCAG compliance, whether customers do the bulk of the work themselves, utilize AudioEye7;s tools and technology to identify and resolve issues together with AudioEye, or fully outsource the work to our experts: ;  ; ; AudioEye Starter : Website owners may accelerate digital accessibility easily and affordably with AudioEye Starter. Upon installing the AudioEye JavaScript, this free product provides users access to a comprehensive site accessibility report, identifying all WCAG risks and errors, as well as access to AudioEye7;s free, on-site developer tools. These are the same tools AudioEye experts use to identify and resolve accessibility errors. Starter is best for customers who wish to manage accessibility on their own, utilizing AudioEye7;s reporting and developer tools to achieve full compliance. Do it yourself digital accessibility.  ;  ; ; AudioEye Pro : Ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, AudioEye Pro customers receive access to AudioEye7;s on-site developer tools as well as more robust WCAG accessibility reports. Further, upon installing the AudioEye JavaScript, AudioEye7;s always-on, proprietary machine-learning/AI-driven technology is automatically identifying and resolving approximately 35% of the most common WCAG accessibility errors. Pro customers may then utilize AudioEye7;s developer tools to resolve the remaining errors. AudioEye Pro customers receive the AudioEye Accessibility Toolbar, which includes website personalization tools for end users, as well as a 24/7 Help Desk for users to report any accessibility-related issues. Pro customers receive an accessibility statement, articulating their commitment to an accessible user experience, as well as access to a library of on-demand digital accessibility training resources. Do it together digital accessibility.  ;  ; ; AudioEye Managed : AudioEye Managed is ideal for those customers interested in completely outsourcing digital accessibility compliance. Upon installing the AudioEye JavaScript, AudioEye Managed customers benefit from AudioEye7;s always-on, proprietary machine-learning/AI-driven technology automatically identifying and resolving the most common WCAG accessibility errors (approximately 35-percent) coupled with AudioEye7;s team of digital accessibility subject matter experts monitoring, manually testing and resolving the remaining errors. This team utilizes the most common assistive technologies on the most common website browsers to ensure site-specific errors are resolved. Managed customers receive the full AudioEye Accessibility Toolbar, including a 24/7 Help Desk, access to a library of on-demand digital accessibility training resources as well as invitations to live, quarterly training sessions. Unlike any solution on the market, AudioEye provides its Managed customers a public Certification Statement, which is AudioEye7;s attestation of a site7;s WCAG compliance. Managed customers also receive a Sustainable Testing &#38; Remediation Plan in the event they are facing legal action. Do it for me digital accessibility. AudioEye Managed is priced according to a site7;s complexity and is designed not only for small and medium-sized businesses on CMS platforms but also for enterprises with customized websites.  ;  ; 6 ;  ; ; AudioEye continues to offer other digital accessibility solutions for both dynamic and static documents (PDFs) as well as mobile applications. ; Customers  ; Our potential customer base includes a very broad range of private and public sector customers, including: ;  ; ; Small &#38; Medium sized businesses,  ;  ; ; Corporate enterprises,  ;  ; ; Federal, state, and local governments and agencies,  ; The Company had one major customer (including such customer7;s affiliates) which accounted for approximately 10% of its revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company had one major customer which generated approximately 11.8% of its revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. ; Small &#38; Medium sized customers  ;  We have recently expanded our offerings via our Marketplace and via partnerships with Duda to capture a much larger market of Small &#38; Medium sized customers. ; Our solutions are sold by our partnership sales team through strategic partnerships, resellers and via our eCommerce platform (Marketplace). This strategy enables us to address all the broad markets covered by our technology and allows for a depth and market penetration that we could never approach on our own. ; Our CMS platform partners and resellers are critical for us to reach this customer segment to both penetrate deeper and more broadly (into multiple industry verticals) by partnering with us to spread awareness and offer a unique solution to make their digital content &#38; websites accessible. ; Corporate Enterprises  ; Corporate Enterprises are larger customers who are served through our enterprise sales team. These companies tend to have more complicated and customized websites that need a deeper resolution to ensure they are compliant with WCAG guidelines. We serve them through multiple offerings. Our Managed services is the biggest part of that offering-set. We also offer PDF remediation and MobileApp guide solutions for them. We believe that the AudioEye products provides a business advantage for our clients by enabling them to better reach the large population of customers who are not able to gain equal access to our clients7; content, products, and services delivered via their websites ; Government and Not-for-Profit Organizations  ; Federal and state laws require that the information and services made available across government agency websites meet the diverse and unique needs of all site visitors. Conforming to Web Accessibility best practices and guidelines helps ensure public access to government information and improves the value of agency investment in their websites and online services. ; The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (0;Rehabilitation Act1;) requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a federal department or agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public without disabilities. The federal government also requires vendors selling to the government to be compliant under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, unless covered by a provable exception. Canada and the European Union have similar requirements. ; Seniors and print-impaired individuals need the Internet7;s critical access to fundamental state, local and federal government services and information such as tax forms, social programs, emergency services and legislative representatives. In addition, the roughly 120,000 federal employees with disabilities require Internet accessibility for workplace productivity. The AudioEye Reader in the cloud provides an intuitive Internet experience across all Internet-enabled devices without imposing any additional costs on end-users. For government site administrators, our Digital Accessibility Platform is designed to be user-friendly so that sites can be made accessible and maintained as part of any web management process.  ;  ; 7 ;  ; ; Over 100 governments have signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Company7;s certification seal demonstrates a website owner7;s commitment to meeting internationally accepted accessibility standards. As a result, our management believes that providing accessibility services for website owners and developers has become a significant market opportunity in view of the potential demand across millions of internet websites. ; The AudioEye solution provides a unique approach to solving a pervasive issue that has inhibited government agencies from embracing efficiencies gained through adopting new cost-effective technological capabilities. More and more federal agencies are beginning to embrace cloud-based service offerings and to leverage the capabilities afforded through the adoption of third-party cloud-based service providers. Implementing the AudioEye solution allows federal, state, and local governments to provide constituents with a reliable, scalable, and fully accessible web environment. By pairing the AudioEye Solution with other disparate SaaS offerings, organizations can more readily comply with the ADA standards. Implementing AudioEye mitigates risk of non-conformance and goes beyond basic levels of compliance through the inclusion of free cloud-based assistive tools, which lives up to the spirit of ADA - a noble and necessary aspiration for all federal, state and local government agencies. ; Our solutions are sold by our enterprise sales team and through strategic partnerships and resellers. This strategy enables us to address all the broad markets covered by our technology and allows for a depth and market penetration that we could never approach on our own. ; Our management believes that the government market imposes certain barriers to entry to new potential entrants. However, our management believes that the potential for recurring revenue generation, the data value appreciation that occurs over time, and low turnover upon establishment of government business all contribute to ideal long-term conditions that make this a good market for us to conduct direct sales. ; The federal government boasts nearly 2,000 top-level .gov domains and 24,000 websites of varying purpose, design, navigation, usability and accessibility. Including the 50 states and all local government websites, there are over 600,000 government websites in the United States. ; Potential additional market segments or verticals of focus include, but are not limited to: ;  ; ; Finance &#38; Banking Institutions; ; ; ; ; ; Travel &#38; Hospitality; ; ; ; ; ; Public &#38; Private Transportation Companies; ; ; ; ; ; Retail and Ecommerce Companies; ; ; ; ; ; Educational Institutions (K-12 and universities as a result of frequent and recent settlement agreements involving and structured by the Department of Justice); ; ; ; ; ; Food Services; and ; ; ; ; ; SaaS Providers.  ; Marketing and Sales  ; In addition to our enterprise sales team, we use strategic business partnerships and development referral partners, for introductions to C-level executives and key stakeholders that directly influence the buying decision of our technology and services. Success in all these efforts is not only critical in order to meet our sales objectives, but also raises market awareness of the Company7;s products and brand. ;  ; 8 ;  ; ; We also have a Partnership sales team that focuses on building and maintaining relationships with CMS providers focused on either specific verticals (e.g. Dealer.com) or who are vertical agnostic (e.g. Duda). ; Our increased focus is now to further strengthen our digital marketing by enhancing the content we share with potential customers and by also ensuring that our Brand image continues to improve as we satisfy our customers and expand our reach and market share in this growing space. ; The Company also attends selected accessibility and industry trade conferences, maintains memberships with key, industry-specific organizations, serves as a subject matter expert within well-attended panels covering industry-related topics, leverages paid search engine optimization for those looking online to learn about or purchase accessibility products or services, and a variety of other conventional marketing and social marketing techniques. ; Competition  ; Website accessibility can be achieved in one of two ways. ; The traditional approach is called a 0;Shift Left1; strategy. On the continuum of an organization7;s software development life cycle, shift left refers to integrating universal design and accessibility testing and analysis as early on in a project (the design and development process) as possible. The idea is to prohibit inaccessible content from reaching production environments . For many businesses and organizations with the right resources and afforded a healthy amount of time, this is absolutely the right thing to do. Without a doubt, websites should be designed, developed, and created with web accessibility in mind. This is why AudioEye offers the Digital Accessibility Platform and provides resources for organizations seeking to empower internal stakeholders to become the subject matter experts. This approach, however, does little to assist organizations being sued based on websites that are already live and public facing. No one has ever been sued for a website that was being built. By the thousands, per year, businesses are being sued because of the sites they have, today, and not the sites they are looking to build in the future. ; AudioEye makes websites accessible. Our solution identifies and remediates accessibility issues with both automated and manual testing and engineering and provides on-going monitoring to ensure sites meet or exceed legal compliance with ADA-related laws and substantially conform with the WCAG, which is the internationally recognized benchmark used to ensure the needs of individuals of disabilities are addressed when it comes to creating and publishing websites and digital content. ; We believe that other competitive solutions are insufficient when it comes to actually achieving substantial conformance with WCAG and removing access barriers that may impede or limit access for individuals with disabilities. These other solutions include: ;  ; ; Automated Testing Tools. These tools are insufficient and not always a viable solution. There are a vast number of automated testing tools. These solutions provide businesses that tend to have very little knowledge of the issues with insights into, approximately, 35% of the overall potential access barriers. Unfortunately, they do not assist businesses in understanding true access barriers and may even provide misleading evidence (e.g. false positives) that further delay product stakeholders time (assuming the business even controls its website 1; i.e. many businesses rely on outsourced niche CMS providers, which leaves their hands tied when it comes to meeting compliance requirements). At the very best, these tools offer potential insight to assist internal stakeholders with information as to how to find and potentially fix, up to only 35% of the issues that are detected by the automated testing suite. The remaining issues require subject matter experts to uncover issues through manual accessibility (AT) testing. ; ; ; ; ; Accessibility Toolbars. These tools are insufficient and not a viable solution by themselves. For as many automated testing tools that can be found in the marketplace, there are just about as many low-cost accessibility toolbars, many of which emulate the leading edge, industry-first web personalization tools that AudioEye supplies free with the Managed Service. On their own, these solutions provide businesses with only incremental benefits that address a small percentage of potential access barriers. Automatic remediation (if any) narrowly addresses WCAG Success Criteria, which provides very little benefit for AT users, who are the ones filing lawsuits against businesses for non-compliance. This approach has worked well in countries outside of the U.S. as evidenced by the large number of international firms attempting to enter the market in the U.S. Until these tool providers achieve validation from U.S.-based security organizations and can pass stringent due diligence examinations, they face an uphill climb. Further, and more importantly, until these tool providers are able to securely and reliably deliver human-based remediation as delivered through their dynamic remediation technology, U.S. companies will gain limited benefit by incorporating and using these highly limited solutions.  ;  ; 9 ;  ; ; In summary, our management believes that the Company7;s technology and solutions will primarily compete against the following: ;  ; 1. Web Accessibility Assessment Technology Providers and Automated Testing Tools. There are a small number of Web Accessibility audit and tracking platform providers, but we do not believe their technology solutions offer the specific end-to-end services offered through the AudioEye Digital Accessibility Platform. Furthermore, their solutions are currently more standalone in that, unlike the Company, they are not combined with a cloud-based tool with a full suite of assistive tools for end-users. ; ; ; ; 2. Web Accessibility Remediation Technology Providers. Currently, other technology providers that utilize technology to apply compliance remediation through a server-side technology do not effectively deploy human-based remediations, nor do they pair their solution with the full breadth of services offered through the AudioEye Managed Platform product suite, including, for example, assistive tools for end-users. These providers are therefore limited in their capacity to provide a fully inclusive user experience for the customers adopting the technology. ; ; ; ; 3. Web Accessibility Consulting Service Providers. There are a substantial number of consulting service providers in the Web Accessibility industry. Each generally provides an analysis of the various compliance issues associated with its clients7; websites. They ultimately provide resources and assistance in applying fixes and changes at the source. While we provide these services, we also provide tools that empower an end-to-end fully managed service, as well as tools that empower self-directed developers to fix issues without requiring source-code remediation. ; ; ; ; 4. Cloud-Based Assistive Technology Providers and Accessibility Toolbars. There are other cloud-based assistive technology providers. However, they do not offer a reliable and trusted solution with compliance detection and remediation for users of existing, native assistive technologies, such as screen readers.  ;   ; 10 ;  ; ; Competitive Strengths  ; Our management believes the following competitive strengths will enable our success in the marketplace: ;  ; ; Unique patented technology . First and foremost, AudioEye builds all its products with the primary goal of enhancing the user experience, in every way possible, regardless of the end-user7;s individual disability or physical limitation. AudioEye is a marketplace technology leader providing what we believe to be unparalleled Web Accessibility solutions for our clients7; customers through our Managed Platform products . We own a unique patent portfolio comprised of six issued patents in the United States and we have additional U.S. patents pending. Our portfolio includes patents and pending patent applications in the United States with over 60 issued claims.  ;  ; ; Freemium model. A Freemium model that enables all website owners to leverage our free tools as well as very reasonably priced offerings all the way to our customized enterprise grade solutions. We believe that having a full-suite of offerings is a competitive differentiator for AudioEye, but the Company must continue to try and differentiate our offerings from a growing list of companies competing in various ways.  ;  ; ; Unique combination of technology and specialized managed service . Our management believes that AudioEye has addressed the problem of Web Accessibility, holistically, and provides a combination of leading-edge technology and high-quality specialized managed service. Our combined solution is designed to provide our clients with access and usability across their digital infrastructure, and to lead to cost-savings and reduced time-to-market for our customers. Our management believes that the AudioEye solution allows our customers to focus not only on achieving compliance, but also on maintaining compliance throughout the life of the subscription.  ; Our current portfolio has established a foundation for building unique technology solutions that contribute to the way in which we differentiate ourselves from other competitors in the B2B Web Accessibility marketplace. In this continued pursuit of expanding the capabilities of our technology and meeting the demands of our customers, AudioEye is committed to growing its IP portfolio. ;  ; ; Highly experienced inventors, technologists and product development team . Our team is comprised of experienced software, e-commerce, mobile marketing and Internet developers and technologists that have worked together for over fifteen years. During their careers, this team has developed several technologies programs for Fortune 500 organizations; federal, state and local governments in the United States, and several leading organizations across the global marketplace.  ; Patent and Trademark Rights  ; Our intellectual property is primarily comprised of trade secrets, trademarks, issued, published and pending patent applications, copyrights and technological innovation. We have a patent portfolio comprised of eight issued patents in the United States. We also have two pending patent applications and two international patent applications filed via the Patent Cooperation Treaty (0;PCT1;). The patents have been extended and cover a period from 2002 through 2038. ; We have eight registered trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The commercial value of these patents is unknown. ;  ; 11 ;  ; ; Legal Landscape and Government Regulation  ; Government regulation in the United States that affects the market and commercial potential for our products and services includes the Rehabilitation Act, the ADA, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 (0;CVAA1;), the Air Carrier Accessibility Act (0;ACAA1;), and various State Laws. ; The Rehabilitation Act requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a federal department or agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public without disabilities. The federal government also requires vendors selling to the government be compliant under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, unless covered by a provable exception. Canada and the European Union have similar requirements. ; The ADA was passed to ensure equal opportunity for people with disabilities. It applies to employment, transportation, state and local government services, and businesses that provide public accommodations or facilities. ; Title II and Title III of the ADA prevent discrimination on the basis of disability in services, programs, and activities provided by public entities (Title II) and private entities considered to be places of public accommodation (Title III). Title II and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act continue to be actively enforced by the Office of Civil Rights (0;OCR1;), who has entered into hundreds of resolution agreements with School Districts and Education Institutions requiring conformance to WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria as managed and monitored through an OCR-validated Accessibility Auditor. ; Under the previous administration, the Department of Justice (0;DOJ1;) was in the process of formulating rules regarding the accessibility of websites and mobile applications. The DOJ had divided its rulemaking into two efforts: the first was intended to provide guidance to state and local entities to comply with Title II, and the second was intended to establish rules for private entities to comply with Title III. Under the new administration, the DOJ has placed the issuance of those rulemakings on the inactive list. However, we believe the absence of any rulemaking will only increase the prevalence of lawsuits filed by plaintiffs seeking issue resolution in continued pursuit of their civil rights as protected under ADA. According to a leading ADA law firm, Seyfarth Shaw, with over 2,258 federal lawsuits filed, federal ADA Title III lawsuits increased by 17% in 2018 due largely to Website Access Lawsuits. This trend is expected to increase in 2020. ; Learn more at www.ada.gov . ; Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Requires that federal agencies7; electronic and information technology is accessible to people with disabilities, including employees and the public. ; The U.S. Government Access Board has updated the requirements to Section 508 compliance standards, commonly referred to as the 0;Section 508 ICT Refresh,1; further formalizing the mandate to adhere to specific web accessibility best practices, namely those outlined under the WCAG, the international standards for web accessibility. Already, a growing number of legal mandates and recent settlements point to the WCAG 2.1 standards as well as making it a requirement to hire third-party Accessibility Subject Matter Experts to maintain an accessibility audit and provide certification 1; sources range from the DOJ, the U.S. Access Board, and the OCR. ; For more information, visit www.section508.gov . ; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act entitles individuals with disabilities to equal access to any program or activity that receives federal subsidy 1; this includes Web-based communications for educational institutions and government agencies. ; In October 2010, the CVAA was enacted to update existing federal laws requiring communications and video programming accessibility and to fill in any current gaps in accessibility to ensure the full inclusion of people with disabilities in all aspects of daily living through accessible, affordable and usable communication and video programming technologies. ;  ; 12 ;  ; ; Per the Department of Transportation, the ACAA (49 U.S.C. 41705) prohibits discrimination by U.S. and foreign air carriers on the basis of physical or mental disability. The Department of Transportation, in interpreting and implementing the ACAA, has issued a rule setting forth the standards of service which air carriers are expected to provide to disabled individuals. ; Beyond the federal level, many states have enacted accessibility laws and, going further, internationally, over 100 Governments have signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. ; As an example, the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, among other things, prohibits discrimination based on disability. More recently, a new law enacted in California, Assembly Bill 434 State Web Accessibility, states that prior to July 1, 2019, each State Agency Director or its Chief Information Officer must post on the homepage of its agency a declaration that the site has been made accessible by meeting the WCAG standards. ; Given the many government regulations in place and/or in process, actions must be taken for businesses to comply with best practices and international standards. This presents a significant business opportunity as more pressure is being put on businesses and organizations to improve the accessibility of their web environments. In addition, from a risk mitigation standpoint, it is best if they consistently and reliably track and demonstrate their level of conformance to these internationally recognized standards over time, the WCAG 2.1. ; Disabilities advocates won a major victory recently after the U.S. Supreme Court left in place an appeals court ruling arguing that Domino7;s website and app must abide by the same rules of accessibility as brick-and-mortar shops. The top court refused to hear a federal appeals court ruling that Domino7;s website and app have to follow Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations and be accessible to people with visual or other impairments. The decision could have broad implications for the restaurant industry, in particular. Chains such as Domino7;s are taking a lot more orders through their website and smartphone apps, making them key places of doing business. The ruling suggests restaurants could be subject to ADA lawsuits if that ordering technology isn7;t accessible to people with disabilities. The case is one of several that disabilities advocates have filed against companies7; websites, seeking to push them to comply with federal accessibilities regulations. ; Employees  ; As of March 30, 2020, we had 84 full-time employees. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that relations with our employees are very good. We have a sincere focus on developing each team member to allow the team member to grow professionally and personally during his or her time with AudioEye.  ; Corporate Information  ; AudioEye, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation on May 20, 2005. On August 1, 2018, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to implement a reverse stock split in the ratio of 1 share for every 25 shares of common stock and to reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock from 250,000,000 to 50,000,000. As a result, 186,994,384 shares of the Company7;s common stock were exchanged for 7,479,775 shares of the Company's common stock. Our financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split. ; Our principal executive offices are located at 5210 East Williams Circle, Suite 750, Tucson Arizona, 85711, and our telephone number at that address is (866) 331-5324. We maintain a website at www.audioeye.com (this reference to our website is an inactive textual reference only and is not intended to incorporate our website into this report). We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (0;SEC1;) and make available, free of charge, on or through our website, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy and information statements and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. In addition, the SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov containing reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Information on the SEC7;s website does not constitute part of this report. Our website also contains copies of our corporate governance guidelines, code of business conduct and ethics, related party transaction policy and whistleblower policy, and copies of the charters for our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee. ;  ; 13 ;  ; ; On February 25, 2020, the Board of Directors (the 0;Board1;) of AudioEye, Inc. appointed Heath Thompson as the Company7;s Chief Executive Officer, effective upon the commencement of his employment with the Company. Mr. Thompson, age 60, joined the Company on March 23, 2020. On February 25, 2020, the Company and Mr. Thompson also entered into an Executive Employment Agreement (the 0;Employment Agreement1;), effective as of March 23, 2020, pursuant to which the Company will employ Mr. Thompson as its Chief Executive Officer on the terms and conditions set forth therein. The Employment Agreement provides for an initial one-year term (the 0;Initial Term1;), with automatic renewals for a one-year term (the 0;Subsequent Term1;) immediately following the Initial Term, and automatic renewals for successive one-year terms immediately following the Subsequent Term, unless the Employment Agreement is terminated as provided therein or either party provides a nonrenewal notice at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term. A copy of the Employment Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.48 to this annual report. Mr. Thompson7;s principal place of employment will be in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. ; On January 13, 2020, Todd Bankofier, Chief Revenue Officer of AudioEye, Inc. (the 0;Company1;), notified the Company of his resignation, effective as of the close of business on January 17, 2020, as Chief Revenue Officer and as an employee of the Company. In connection with the termination of Mr. Bankofier7;s employment, Mr. Bankofier and the Company entered in to a Severance Agreement and General Release of Claims dated as of January 17, 2020 pursuant to which Mr. Bankofier received certain severance compensation and benefits. A copy of the Severance Agreement and General Release of Claims is filed as Exhibit 10.47 to this annual report.  ; \n"
